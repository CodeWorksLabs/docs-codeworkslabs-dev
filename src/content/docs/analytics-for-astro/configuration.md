description: Strict provider, environment, pageview, and consent configuration.

The default export accepts one `AstroAnalyticsConfig` object. Configuration is
strictly checked at runtime: unknown fields, symbol keys, malformed values, and
non-record objects are rejected with `TypeError`.

Fathom, Plausible, Google Analytics 4, and Matomo settings drive implemented
Milestone 2 adapters.

> **Planned provider:** Umami remains part of the accepted first-stable provider
> set, but alpha.8 does not accept its provider name or configuration.

## Root configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Current behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `providers` | `false` or non-empty provider array | Required | `false` disables the integration; an array enables one or more independently reported providers |
| `provider` | `false` or provider object | Deprecated | Compatibility input for one provider; cannot be combined with `providers` |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Master integration switch |
| `environments` | object | Production only | Selects Astro config-setup commands that may inject analytics |
| `events` | `boolean` or deprecated options object | `false` | `true` installs the package event client; the legacy object form is accepted as enabled compatibility input |
| `debug` | `boolean` | `false` | Reserved normalized setting; Milestone 2 emits no debug output |

Only the listed keys are accepted.

Provider order is preserved. Duplicate provider names are rejected because one
runtime adapter owns each provider identity. An empty array is rejected; use
`providers: false` to disable analytics. Simultaneous sources belong in one
`providers` array so pageview, consent, readiness, and event outcomes remain
independent and observable.

## Environments

```ts
{
  production?: boolean;  // default true; Astro command: build
  preview?: boolean;     // default false; Astro command: preview
  development?: boolean; // default false; Astro command: dev
}
```

Each field is independent. The Astro `sync` command is always disabled.

This policy is evaluated by the integration during Astro configuration setup.
Injection becomes part of generated output; the flags are not runtime kill
switches. In particular, `astro preview` serves an existing build and does not
remove analytics that was included when that output was built.

## Pageview modes

Every provider accepts an optional `pageviews` field:

| Value | Intended ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `"provider"` | Pageviews triggered after Astro page-load events; the default |
| `"astro"` | Explicitly selects the same Astro page-load lifecycle |
| `"none"` | No automatic pageviews |

All three modes are implemented for Fathom, Plausible, Google Analytics 4, and Matomo.
For Matomo, `"none"` still maintains the last completed Astro route's URL,
title, and virtual-referrer context so custom events are attributed correctly;
it never calls `trackPageView`.

## Google Analytics 4

```js
analytics({
  providers: [
    {
      name: "google-analytics",
      measurementId: "G-EXAMPLE123",
      consent: {
        mode: "deferred",
        initial: {
          analyticsStorage: "denied",
          adStorage: "denied",
          adUserData: "denied",
          adPersonalization: "denied",
        },
      },
      pageviews: "provider",
    },
  ],
});
```

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Exactly `"google-analytics"` |
| `measurementId` | Required non-empty `G-` identifier containing letters or digits |
| `consent.mode` | Required: `"immediate"`, `"deferred"`, or `"external"` |
| `consent.initial.analyticsStorage` | Required when `initial` is present; `"granted"` or `"denied"` |
| Other initial consent fields | Optional `"granted"` or `"denied"` values |
| `scriptSrc` | Optional absolute HTTPS URL without credentials; defaults to the GA4 gtag URL |
| `config` | Optional plain record of strings, finite numbers, and booleans; `send_page_view` is always forced to `false` |
| `pageviews` | Optional pageview mode; default `"provider"` |

With `consent.mode: "immediate"`, the adapter creates package-owned `gtag` and
`dataLayer` globals, emits any configured consent default before `config`, and
loads gtag.js. `deferred` and `external` fail closed as `consent-pending` until a
future consent-transition API is implemented. When `initial` is supplied, set
all four Consent Mode v2 storage fields to the site's actual policy.

The adapter always disables the config command's eager pageview and sends
manual `page_view` events after Astro's post-swap `astro:page-load` signal. It
includes the current location and title and carries the preceding virtual URL as
the next pageview's referrer. In the GA4 web stream, also disable **Page changes
based on browser history events** under Enhanced Measurement; otherwise GA4 can
send duplicate SPA pageviews independently of `send_page_view: false`.

Custom events accept at most 25 properties. `send_to` is reserved and rejected
in caller properties because the adapter supplies the configured Measurement ID.

## Plausible

```js
analytics({
  providers: [
    {
      name: "plausible",
      scriptSrc: "https://analytics.example.com/js/script.js",
      endpoint: "https://analytics.example.com/api/event",
      consent: { mode: "immediate" },
      captureOnLocalhost: false,
      pageviews: "provider",
    },
  ],
});
```

`scriptSrc` is required. `scriptSrc` and `endpoint` must be absolute HTTPS URLs
without embedded credentials. `captureOnLocalhost` must be boolean. Consent, when
present, contains only `mode`. The script URL is Plausible's current
site-specific snippet URL, such as `https://plausible.io/js/pa-XXXXX.js`.

The adapter calls `plausible.init()` before loading the script with
`autoCapturePageviews: false`, the configured endpoint when present, and the
configured localhost policy. Astro owns initial and client-navigation
pageviews. Omit consent or use `immediate` to load Plausible; `deferred` and
`external` fail closed until the shared consent controller is implemented.

## Fathom

```js
analytics({
  providers: [
    {
      name: "fathom",
      siteId: "YOUR-SITE-ID",
      consent: { mode: "external" },
      honorDnt: true,
      canonical: true,
      pageviews: "provider",
    },
  ],
});
```

`siteId` is required and is trimmed. `scriptSrc` is optional and defaults to
`https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js`. `honorDnt` and `canonical` must be boolean.
Consent, when present, contains only `mode`. Omit consent or use `immediate` to
load Fathom. `deferred` and `external` fail closed: the vendor is not loaded and
event calls return `consent-pending` because this candidate has no activation API.
Consent mode is fixed before the first Fathom load attempt. A conflicting later
bootstrap cannot retroactively cancel an already prepared vendor script and is
therefore ignored; no runtime consent-transition API is provided.

For Fathom, `honorDnt: true` emits `data-honor-dnt="true"` and
`canonical: false` emits `data-canonical="false"`. The default
`pageviews: "provider"` disables Fathom's eager automation and invokes Fathom
after Astro's `astro:page-load` event so canonical content has already swapped
on client navigation, including browser history traversal. Initial script
readiness sends the initial document only when no navigation is in flight. If a
post-swap page-load arrives before Fathom is ready, it is retained and sent once
the vendor loads; a load during an in-flight navigation waits for the post-swap
signal. `pageviews: "astro"` currently selects the same behavior explicitly.
`pageviews: "none"` sends no pageviews.

## Disabled configuration

```js
analytics({ providers: false });
```

This disables injection even if `events: true` or an environment flag is true.

## Matomo

```js
analytics({
  providers: [
    {
      name: "matomo",
      trackerUrl: "https://analytics.example.com/matomo.php",
      siteId: "1",
      eventCategory: "Website",
      consent: { mode: "immediate" },
      pageviews: "provider",
    },
  ],
  events: true,
});
```

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Exactly `"matomo"` |
| `trackerUrl` | Required absolute HTTPS URL ending in `/matomo.php`, without credentials, query, or fragment |
| `siteId` | Required positive integer string |
| `eventCategory` | Required non-empty string of at most 128 characters |
| `scriptSrc` | Optional absolute HTTPS URL; defaults to `matomo.js` beside `trackerUrl` |
| `consent.mode` | Optional: `"immediate"`, `"deferred"`, or `"external"`; omitted means immediate |
| `pageviews` | Optional pageview mode; default `"provider"` |

The adapter creates the standard `_paq` startup queue and, after validated
script readiness, adopts Matomo's replacement command proxy. It configures the
exact tracker URL and site ID and loads `matomo.js`. It deliberately omits
Matomo's eager `trackPageView` call. Astro sends initial and client-navigation
pageviews with current URL and title plus the preceding virtual URL as referrer.
The adapter does not enable Matomo's automatic link tracking. Completed route
history remains separate from a pending send, so delayed readiness, failed-load
intervals, and retries do not replay stale pageviews. With `pageviews: "none"`,
the same route context is applied for custom events without automatic pageviews.

Matomo starts only after the singleton Astro navigation observer is registered.
After an observation gap, it waits for the next actual Astro page-load event,
uses that route, and explicitly clears Matomo's referrer rather than inventing
an edge from a potentially stale external document referrer. Later observed
navigations restore ordinary virtual-referrer edges.

Immediate consent loads Matomo. Deferred and external modes fail closed without
creating `_paq` or loading the tracker and report `consent-pending`; runtime
consent activation is not yet part of alpha.8.

## Planned: Umami

The planned Umami adapter will support Umami Cloud and self-hosted Umami. Its
eventual configuration is expected to require a public tracker script URL and
website ID, disable automatic pageviews, and use Astro-owned pageviews plus
bounded custom events. Consent behavior, custom-event mapping, URL validation,
and exact field names remain subject to implementation and review. Do not add
an `umami` provider to alpha.8.
