The default export accepts one `AstroAnalyticsConfig` object. Configuration is
strictly checked at runtime: unknown fields, symbol keys, malformed values, and
non-record objects are rejected with `TypeError`.

Fathom, Plausible, and Google Analytics 4 settings drive implemented Milestone
2 adapters.

> **Planned providers:** Matomo and Umami are part of the accepted first-stable
> provider set, but alpha.7 does not accept either provider name or
> configuration. The notes below describe implementation intent, not usable
> configuration.

## Root configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Current behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `providers` | `false` or non-empty provider array | Required | `false` disables the integration; an array enables one or more independently reported providers |
| `provider` | `false` or provider object | Deprecated | Compatibility input for one provider; cannot be combined with `providers` |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Master integration switch |
| `environments` | object | Production only | Selects Astro config-setup commands that may inject analytics |
| `events` | `boolean` or deprecated options object | `false` | `true` installs the package event client; the legacy object form is accepted as enabled compatibility input |
| `debug` | `boolean` | `false` | Reserved normalized setting; Milestone 2 emits no debug output |

Only the listed keys are accepted.

Provider order is preserved. Duplicate provider names are rejected because one
runtime adapter owns each provider identity. An empty array is rejected; use
`providers: false` to disable analytics. Simultaneous sources belong in one
`providers` array so pageview, consent, readiness, and event outcomes remain
independent and observable.

## Environments

```ts
{
  production?: boolean;  // default true; Astro command: build
  preview?: boolean;     // default false; Astro command: preview
  development?: boolean; // default false; Astro command: dev
}
```

Each field is independent. The Astro `sync` command is always disabled.

This policy is evaluated by the integration during Astro configuration setup.
Injection becomes part of generated output; the flags are not runtime kill
switches. In particular, `astro preview` serves an existing build and does not
remove analytics that was included when that output was built.

## Pageview modes

Every provider accepts an optional `pageviews` field:

| Value | Intended ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `"provider"` | Pageviews triggered after Astro page-load events; the default |
| `"astro"` | Explicitly selects the same Astro page-load lifecycle |
| `"none"` | No automatic pageviews |

All three modes are implemented for Fathom, Plausible, and Google Analytics 4.

## Google Analytics 4

```js
analytics({
  providers: [
    {
      name: "google-analytics",
      measurementId: "G-EXAMPLE123",
      consent: {
        mode: "deferred",
        initial: {
          analyticsStorage: "denied",
          adStorage: "denied",
          adUserData: "denied",
          adPersonalization: "denied",
        },
      },
      pageviews: "provider",
    },
  ],
});
```

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Exactly `"google-analytics"` |
| `measurementId` | Required non-empty `G-` identifier containing letters or digits |
| `consent.mode` | Required: `"immediate"`, `"deferred"`, or `"external"` |
| `consent.initial.analyticsStorage` | Required when `initial` is present; `"granted"` or `"denied"` |
| Other initial consent fields | Optional `"granted"` or `"denied"` values |
| `scriptSrc` | Optional absolute HTTPS URL without credentials; defaults to the GA4 gtag URL |
| `config` | Optional plain record of strings, finite numbers, and booleans; `send_page_view` is always forced to `false` |
| `pageviews` | Optional pageview mode; default `"provider"` |

With `consent.mode: "immediate"`, the adapter creates package-owned `gtag` and
`dataLayer` globals, emits any configured consent default before `config`, and
loads gtag.js. `deferred` and `external` fail closed as `consent-pending` until a
future consent-transition API is implemented. When `initial` is supplied, set
all four Consent Mode v2 storage fields to the site's actual policy.

The adapter always disables the config command's eager pageview and sends
manual `page_view` events after Astro's post-swap `astro:page-load` signal. It
includes the current location and title and carries the preceding virtual URL as
the next pageview's referrer. In the GA4 web stream, also disable **Page changes
based on browser history events** under Enhanced Measurement; otherwise GA4 can
send duplicate SPA pageviews independently of `send_page_view: false`.

Custom events accept at most 25 properties. `send_to` is reserved and rejected
in caller properties because the adapter supplies the configured Measurement ID.

## Plausible

```js
analytics({
  providers: [
    {
      name: "plausible",
      scriptSrc: "https://analytics.example.com/js/script.js",
      endpoint: "https://analytics.example.com/api/event",
      consent: { mode: "immediate" },
      captureOnLocalhost: false,
      pageviews: "provider",
    },
  ],
});
```

`scriptSrc` is required. `scriptSrc` and `endpoint` must be absolute HTTPS URLs
without embedded credentials. `captureOnLocalhost` must be boolean. Consent, when
present, contains only `mode`. The script URL is Plausible's current
site-specific snippet URL, such as `https://plausible.io/js/pa-XXXXX.js`.

The adapter calls `plausible.init()` before loading the script with
`autoCapturePageviews: false`, the configured endpoint when present, and the
configured localhost policy. Astro owns initial and client-navigation
pageviews. Omit consent or use `immediate` to load Plausible; `deferred` and
`external` fail closed until the shared consent controller is implemented.

## Fathom

```js
analytics({
  providers: [
    {
      name: "fathom",
      siteId: "YOUR-SITE-ID",
      consent: { mode: "external" },
      honorDnt: true,
      canonical: true,
      pageviews: "provider",
    },
  ],
});
```

`siteId` is required and is trimmed. `scriptSrc` is optional and defaults to
`https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js`. `honorDnt` and `canonical` must be boolean.
Consent, when present, contains only `mode`. Omit consent or use `immediate` to
load Fathom. `deferred` and `external` fail closed: the vendor is not loaded and
event calls return `consent-pending` because this candidate has no activation API.
Consent mode is fixed before the first Fathom load attempt. A conflicting later
bootstrap cannot retroactively cancel an already prepared vendor script and is
therefore ignored; no runtime consent-transition API is provided.

For Fathom, `honorDnt: true` emits `data-honor-dnt="true"` and
`canonical: false` emits `data-canonical="false"`. The default
`pageviews: "provider"` disables Fathom's eager automation and invokes Fathom
after Astro's `astro:page-load` event so canonical content has already swapped
on client navigation, including browser history traversal. Initial script
readiness sends the initial document only when no navigation is in flight. If a
post-swap page-load arrives before Fathom is ready, it is retained and sent once
the vendor loads; a load during an in-flight navigation waits for the post-swap
signal. `pageviews: "astro"` currently selects the same behavior explicitly.
`pageviews: "none"` sends no pageviews.

## Disabled configuration

```js
analytics({ providers: false });
```

This disables injection even if `events: true` or an environment flag is true.

## Planned: Matomo

The planned Matomo adapter will support Matomo Cloud and self-hosted Matomo. Its
eventual configuration is expected to require a public tracker base URL and a
Matomo site ID, disable the vendor's eager pageview, and send initial and
client-navigation pageviews from Astro's post-swap lifecycle. Consent behavior,
custom-event mapping, URL validation, and exact field names remain subject to
implementation and review. Do not add a `matomo` provider to alpha.7.

## Planned: Umami

The planned Umami adapter will support Umami Cloud and self-hosted Umami. Its
eventual configuration is expected to require a public tracker script URL and
website ID, disable automatic pageviews, and use Astro-owned pageviews plus
bounded custom events. Consent behavior, custom-event mapping, URL validation,
and exact field names remain subject to implementation and review. Do not add
an `umami` provider to alpha.7.
