Analytics for Astro follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Git tags,
matching GitHub Releases, and any authorized npm artifact identify published
versions. Until those actions occur, an entry is a candidate record, not a
release claim.

## Unreleased

- Prepare public documentation for the Analytics for Astro title and clearly
  mark Matomo and Umami as planned first-stable providers that are not accepted
  or loaded by alpha.7.
- Correct the event guide to include the implemented Google Analytics 4 event
  path alongside Fathom and Plausible.

## 0.1.0-alpha.7 - Candidate

- Correct the GA4 `gtag()` queue contract to push the canonical JavaScript
  `arguments` object expected by Google's loader rather than an ordinary array.
- Add a regression assertion for the command object's runtime identity after
  live sandbox testing showed that alpha.6 loaded gtag.js but sent no data.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6 - Candidate

- Add the Google Analytics 4 adapter with explicit Consent Mode configuration,
  an owned `gtag`/`dataLayer` bootstrap, and isolated Measurement ID routing.
- Force `send_page_view: false` and send initial and client-navigation
  `page_view` events from Astro's post-swap lifecycle with current location,
  title, and virtual referrer data.
- Forward bounded custom event parameters to GA4 and report loading,
  ready, consent-pending, and per-event outcomes through the shared client.
- Fail closed on occupied Google globals, script collisions, deferred or
  external consent, script failure, and reserved `send_to` event parameters.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5 - Candidate

- Add the Plausible adapter using its current site-specific script and
  `plausible.init()` contract with automatic pageviews disabled.
- Send initial and client-navigation Plausible pageviews from Astro's
  post-swap lifecycle and forward up to 30 custom event properties.
- Add `providerStatuses()` so operator surfaces can distinguish configured
  event adapters from verified runtime readiness without sending probe events
  when `events: true` installs the shared client.
- Report Fathom and Plausible loading, ready, and consent-pending states through
  the shared client while preserving independent multi-provider outcomes.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 - Candidate

- Add plural `providers` configuration for simultaneous analytics sources while
  retaining singular `provider` as a deprecated compatibility input.
- Add a runtime provider registry that isolates adapter readiness and event
  failures instead of allowing one adapter to overwrite another.
- Return exact per-provider results from `track()` and expose
  `configuredProviders()` for operator-facing diagnostics.
- Preserve a top-level failure reason only when every configured provider fails
  for the same reason; mixed outcomes remain explicitly visible.
- Reject empty provider arrays, duplicate provider names, and simultaneous use
  of the singular and plural configuration fields.
- Retain the legacy `events` options object as deprecated enabled input while
  keeping the current event client queue-free and fixed at `astroAnalytics`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 - Candidate

- Narrow peer eligibility to Astro `>=7.3.2 <8` and Starlight
  `>=0.41.11 <0.43` after the latest Astro 5 and 6 patch lines failed the
  production dependency audit with critical upstream advisories.
- Qualify clean stock Astro 7.3.2 and stock Starlight 0.41.11 and 0.42.0
  consumers on Node.js 22.22.2.
- Record successful live Fathom pageview, installation, and public `track()`
  event verification on the dedicated Astro and Starlight sandboxes.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 - Candidate

- Add the first real provider adapter for Fathom Analytics.
- Trigger Fathom pageviews from Astro's post-swap page-load lifecycle so initial,
  client-side, and browser-history navigation use current canonical metadata.
- Defer delayed vendor readiness during an in-flight navigation until Astro has
  emitted the destination's post-swap lifecycle signal.
- Replace forgeable runtime-state reuse with DOM-verified script reuse and
  fail-closed state publication before listener or script side effects.
- Select and rediscover a genuinely unused bounded script ID when unrelated DOM
  elements occupy the primary or fallback IDs.
- Preserve non-executable URL deduplication across verified same-script reuse and
  reject inert or configuration-incompatible script reuse. Recovery from a
  disconnected or untrusted script may repeat the current pageview, and failed
  best-effort listener removal leaves the superseded callback inert rather than
  preventing the replacement generation.
- Require guarded `Symbol.for()` lookup to return a symbol before any document
  coordination property is read or written.
- Explicitly disable dynamic-script force-async behavior and ignore late load or
  error callbacks from a superseded runtime generation.
- Load Fathom's deferred embed for enabled production builds and connect the
  package event helper to `fathom.trackEvent()` after the vendor API is ready.
- Map Fathom DNT, canonical, automatic, and Astro-owned pageview settings.
- Fail closed for deferred or externally managed consent until a future consent
  activation API is implemented.
- Publish and verify revocable runtime state before exposing the event client,
  and retain the latest post-swap pageview while Fathom is still loading.
- Reject same-document changes from an already-started immediate runtime to a
  pending consent mode because browser script execution cannot be reliably undone.
- Delay manual pageviews during browser prerendering until activation.
- Treat a loaded script without Fathom's pageview API as a failed generation and
  keep failure cleanup independent of externally frozen lifecycle state.
- Bind reusable document coordination state to an unpredictable per-module proof
  so lookalikes cannot suppress startup and matching integrations deduplicate.
- Avoid replaying historical pre-ready routes with incorrect live query
  attribution; coalesce them to the latest current navigation instead.
- Retain the authenticated callback generation when reusing a matching live
  script, without trusting replaceable document lifecycle or readiness fields.
- Deduplicate repeated lifecycle signals by browser navigation rather than by
  canonical reporting payload, preserving distinct canonicalized visits.
- Bound delayed-vendor state to one pending current navigation.
- Reuse the authenticated document and script listeners on matching reentry
  rather than attaching duplicate load, error, or page-load listeners.
- Invalidate superseded pending-consent clients before reporting consent state.
- Enforce the documented event name and property limits at the declared global
  client boundary as well as in the imported helper.
- Prevent validation-only provider fallbacks from overwriting an active
  package-branded Fathom event client.
- Gate event dispatch on this integration generation's verified vendor readiness
  so a preexisting unrelated Fathom API cannot receive events.
- Carry a closure-backed verified-load proof across matching bootstrap reentry so
  a still-downloading owned script cannot inherit readiness from an unrelated API.
- Keep authoritative generation identity in a non-replaceable coordinator
  closure, treating document and script records as inspection-only; preserve the
  original navigation guard and latest completed pending page across reentry;
  recover terminal callbacks through temporary inspection-state replacement;
  and align direct callable-property rejection.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 - Candidate

- Add strict runtime normalization for disabled, Google Analytics, Plausible,
  and Fathom provider configuration.
- Add explicit production, preview, and development enablement.
- Add the opt-in, non-networking event fallback and bounded `track()` helper.
- Add the core Astro integration and Starlight plugin wrapper.
- Add hostile-global, configuration, integration, event, and type coverage.
- Add package-consumer documentation for setup, configuration, events,
  Starlight, runtime safety, development, API coverage, verification, and
  versioning.
- Use private package import maps for consumer-compatible internal module
  resolution in the published TypeScript source package.

This candidate does not load analytics vendors, send events or pageviews,
queue data, or make external requests.
