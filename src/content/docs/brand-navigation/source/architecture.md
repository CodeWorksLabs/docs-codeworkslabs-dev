## Render boundary

The initializer registers the configured full-application outlet only when
`EmbedMode.enabled` is false. The bar and mobile-menu components repeat the
same guard so an already-registered component still refuses to render if the
context changes.

`EmbedMode` comes from the supported `discourse/lib/embed-mode` module. No
hostname, parent-frame, DOM selector, or CSS visibility test is used.

Classic `/embed/comments` discussions use Discourse's separate server-rendered
embed layout. That layout exposes `embedded_header`, not the normal
`above-site-header`, `below-site-header`, or `home-logo__before` application
outlets used here. Brand Navigation provides no `embedded_header` customization.

Together these boundaries keep site-global content out of both supported embed
paths without touching topic content, navigation, sign-in, reply, like, quote,
or composer behavior.

## Components

- `brand-navigation` initializer: guarded bar outlet and site-header icon
  registration.
- `BrandNavigationBar`: desktop and optional mobile-bar boundary.
- `brand-navigation-menu`: guarded compact mobile header entry.
- `BrandNavigationContent`: shared brand and navigation presentation.
- `BrandNavigationHeaderIcon`: guarded direct links registered through
  Discourse's supported `api.headerIcons` API.
- `brand-navigation` library: audience and safe-link policy.

## Configuration model

`navigation_items` uses Discourse's supported nested `objects` theme setting.
Ordering is the editor's list order. A top-level entry with children uses a
native `details` submenu. When that entry also has a URL, its label remains a
normal link and a separate summary caret controls the submenu; without a URL,
the complete summary is the submenu control. Only one child level is represented
by the schema. Top-level entries are grouped into
logical `left` and `right` sections; CSS logical properties keep that layout
usable in both left-to-right and right-to-left interfaces.

The objects editor uses the component-specific schema identity
`brand_navigation_item_v1`. Its save-stay behavior requires that identity. The
component-wide appearance and bundle panel requires a theme component with the
five-setting Brand Navigation signature. This avoids repository-location and
mutable-name coupling while failing closed for incomplete signatures; it is a
product signature, not cryptographic identity. Bundle imports validate the
complete portable schema, preflight every target, snapshot the submitted data,
and submit one Discourse theme update rather than issuing a separate request
for each setting. While a request is pending, conflicting controls are disabled.
After success, the model and appearance controls reconcile from the submitted
snapshot. This does not assert a server-side transaction guarantee; after a
server error, reload the current settings before retrying.

Top-level items with the `site_header` surface are excluded from the bar and
registered as direct icon links through `api.headerIcons`. They require a URL
and icon and do not support children. A locally authored lexical component
factory binds each validated item to its header component without
repository-specific owner state.

Each item can render as icon-and-label, label-only, or icon-only. Labels remain
required and provide accessible names even when visually omitted. An icon-only
bar or submenu entry with no usable icon falls back to visible label text.
Site-header entries with unavailable icons do not render, avoiding an empty
core-header control. Availability is determined from the symbols actually
loaded in Discourse's production SVG sprite; development-only icon-list
metadata is not used. One shared `MutationObserver` watches Discourse's primary
Font Awesome sprite until it contains symbols, then notifies all live Brand
Navigation consumers once and disconnects. This works with both the 2026.7 ESR
loader and current Discourse without issuing per-icon network requests. Until
the primary sprite is ready, icon-only bar/submenu entries expose their labels
and direct header entries stay omitted. Destroyed components unsubscribe, and
the tracked readiness update is scheduled after the active render transaction.
A retained direct-header component synchronizes its subscription whenever its
responsive eligibility is reevaluated, so becoming eligible before sprite
readiness still receives the single shared notification.
Audience/device-ineligible entries do not create subscriptions. Top-level and
child items independently select `both`, `desktop`, or `mobile` device visibility.
The components evaluate that setting against Discourse's supported
`capabilities.isMobileDevice` state and omit nonmatching items from rendering,
so phone rotation cannot reclassify items. Component-wide responsive layout
continues to use `site.mobileView` through the bar and menu boundaries.

Navigation sinks independently recheck URL safety and fail closed for malformed,
protocol-relative, credential-bearing, non-HTTPS external, and script URLs.
The optional local bundle validator reads bounded files and never connects to a
forum. Browser import/export uses the authenticated Discourse administrator
session and the component's administration page. Import validation also
enforces Discourse's 524,288-byte serialized object-setting limit before any
settings request is sent; the complete bundle retains its separate
1,000,000-byte file limit.

## Intentional constraints

Native `details`/`summary` provides keyboard operation without a custom focus
state machine. Brand Navigation permits one open submenu at a time and closes
it after outside interaction, Escape, or link selection. Escape returns focus
to the submenu summary. Internal and external URLs use the same validated
setting; `_blank` links automatically receive `noopener noreferrer`.
