This guide explains how to install, configure, verify, and disable Brand
Navigation. The component adds site-wide brand identity and one-level
navigation to normal Discourse application pages.

## Before you begin

- Test the component on a staging site or copied theme before enabling it for
  visitors.
- You need access to Discourse theme administration.
- Decide whether the bar should appear above or below the normal Discourse
  header.
- Prepare a brand name, destination, and optional light- and dark-scheme logos.
- List the navigation links and submenus you want to create.

Brand Navigation does not replace Discourse authentication, topic navigation,
the composer, or other core controls. It does not appear inside supported
Discourse embed contexts.

## Install the component

1. In Discourse administration, open **Appearance → Themes & components**.
2. Select the **Components** tab, choose **Install → From a git repository**,
   and enter:

   ```text
   https://github.com/CodeWorksLabs/brand-navigation.git
   ```

3. Do not attach the component to a visitor-facing theme yet. Add it to a
   non-default staging theme that visitors do not use.
4. Turn Discourse's component-level **Enabled?** control on. Discourse does not
   load a disabled component's JavaScript, including Brand Navigation's bundle
   panel.
5. Use Discourse's **Preview** control for the staging theme, then open Brand
   Navigation's settings in that preview context. Configure the supplied sample
   settings or import a configuration bundle and verify the staging preview.
6. Attach the prepared component to the intended visitor-facing theme only when
   the navigation is ready.

Discourse's component-level **Enabled?** control is the single source of truth
for activation. Brand Navigation intentionally has no separate enable setting.

The exact administration labels can vary slightly between Discourse releases.

## Updates and upgrades

Yes. When Brand Navigation is installed from its Git repository, it uses the
normal Discourse remote-theme update system. The component does not implement
its own updater and does not contact a separate Brand Navigation service.

Discourse periodically checks remote themes and components for changes. An
administrator can also open Brand Navigation under **Appearance → Themes &
components** and select **Check for updates**. When Discourse finds a newer
revision, the control changes to **Update to latest**. Remote components are
eligible for Discourse's automatic-update behavior when that option is enabled
for the installation.

Install from the repository's default branch rather than pinning a custom
branch. Brand Navigation's `main` branch targets current Discourse. For a
maintained older Discourse release, the updater automatically selects the
matching `d-compat/<YYYY>.<M>` branch when one exists. This selection is part of
Discourse's native remote-theme update behavior; administrators do not need to
choose the compatibility branch manually.

This tracking only applies when Brand Navigation was installed from its Git
repository. A component imported from a file or created locally is not linked
to this repository and therefore cannot receive its updates through the normal
remote-theme check.

### Recommended upgrade process

1. Read the Brand Navigation release notes for configuration, compatibility,
   and migration information.
2. Record or export the current component settings.
3. Apply the update to a staging site or staging theme first.
4. Verify desktop and mobile navigation, signed-in and signed-out visibility,
   links, color schemes, and an embedded discussion.
5. Update the production component through Discourse's **Update to latest**
   control.
6. Repeat the focused checks on production.

Discourse normally retains site-specific theme settings when it updates the
component's code from Git. Recording the settings first still provides a safe
recovery reference if a release changes the settings schema or defaults.

### Move settings with a configuration bundle

Brand Navigation includes a versioned JSON bundle tool so an administrator can
export, validate, and apply a complete portable configuration without entering
each navigation row again. Bundles contain the portable theme settings plus
non-functional export metadata: `exported_at`, `source_theme_id`, and
`source_theme_name`. The importer does not apply those metadata fields. Bundles
do not contain API credentials, uploaded logo identifiers, theme attachments,
or an instruction to enable the component.

On the Brand Navigation administration page, the **Configuration bundles**
panel appears immediately above the Preview/Export/Disable controls. Select
**Export settings** to download the current portable configuration. To import,
select **Choose bundle** and pick a `.json` bundle, or paste its contents into
**Or paste bundle JSON**. Review any validation errors and then select **Import
settings**.

Discourse loads a theme component's custom administrator JavaScript only when
the component is enabled and belongs to the resolved theme. For a newly
installed component, use the non-default staging-theme procedure in
[Install the component](#install-the-component): attach Brand Navigation only to that staging
theme, enable the component, open the staging theme's Discourse preview, and
then open Brand Navigation's settings within the preview context. Import and
verify the bundle before attaching the component to a visitor-facing theme.

Turning the native **Enabled?** control off also removes the custom bundle
panel. This is expected Discourse component loading behavior, not a separate
Brand Navigation activation state.

The browser importer validates the complete portable schema and submits all
settings in one Discourse theme update. It does not intentionally save a partial
bundle. If the browser loses the response after submission, reload the
component settings and verify the displayed values before retrying.
Conflicting appearance, file, paste, and export controls remain disabled while
a save or import is pending. Export refuses to create a download larger than
the 1,000,000-byte file ceiling or with navigation data larger than Discourse's
524,288-byte serialized object-setting limit, so every successful download
remains eligible for re-import.

An optional local command validates a saved bundle without contacting a forum:

```text
pnpm bundle validate configurations/repeal-obbba.json
```

Import and export are intentionally administrator-browser operations in the
`v0.9.x` preview line. Brand Navigation does not ship a credentialed
command-line client. Upload light and dark logos separately because Discourse
upload identifiers are site-specific.

### If an upgrade causes a problem

1. Turn off Discourse's component-level **Enabled?** control to stop Brand
   Navigation from rendering.
2. If Brand Navigation replaced another component, follow the documented
   rollback procedure and temporarily re-enable that component.
3. To return Brand Navigation itself to a known release, follow
   [Roll back Brand Navigation to a release tag](/brand-navigation/source/migration-record/#roll-back-brand-navigation-to-a-release-tag).
   That procedure remains provisional until its complete staging evidence is
   recorded in [`TESTING.md`](/brand-navigation/source/testing-record/). It handles an already-disabled
   component by first isolating it on a non-default staging theme, then turning
   native **Enabled?** on before requiring the preview or configuration export.
4. Restore the previously recorded settings when required.
5. Report the Brand Navigation release, Discourse version, active theme, and
   observed error before trying the update again.

Do not edit a Git-installed remote component locally to patch an upgrade.
Maintain custom overrides in a separate local component, or use a maintained
fork when code changes are required.

## Configure the brand

The brand area is optional. Set `show_brand` off when you only want navigation.

| Setting              | Purpose                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `brand_name`         | Brand text and the accessible label for the brand link.                       |
| `brand_url`          | Destination opened when a visitor selects the brand.                          |
| `brand_logo`         | Logo for light color schemes.                                                 |
| `brand_logo_dark`    | Optional logo for dark color schemes. The light logo is the fallback.         |
| `brand_presentation` | Display the logo and name, only the logo, or only the name.                   |
| `brand_target`       | Open the destination in the same window (`_self`) or a new window (`_blank`). |

If neither a usable logo nor a brand name is configured, the brand area stays
empty even when `show_brand` is on.

## Configure colors

The **Appearance** panel on the Brand Navigation administration page provides
color pickers for the bar background, bar text and icons, hover/highlight
background, submenu background, and submenu text and icons. Each color can be
overridden independently.

Leave **Custom** off to inherit the active Discourse color scheme. This is the
recommended starting point because inherited colors automatically follow the
site's light and dark palettes. Turn **Custom** on for a color, choose a value,
and select **Save colors** to override it. **Inherit all** clears all five
overrides and returns the component to Discourse's palette variables.

Appearance values are included in Brand Navigation configuration bundle
exports. Colors may be entered as `#1A2B3C` or `1A2B3C`; the component renders
both forms and normalizes picker and bundle values to canonical `#RRGGBB`.

## Add navigation

Open `navigation_items` and add entries in the order they should appear.
Selecting **Save Changes** persists the complete navigation configuration and
keeps you in the structured editor so you can continue working or verify the
saved entry. Use the Brand Navigation breadcrumb when you are ready to return
to the component's main settings page.

Each top-level entry supports:

| Field               | Purpose                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `label`             | Required visible text.                                                                     |
| `url`               | Destination for the top-level label. It may also be used when the entry has submenu items. |
| `link_mode`         | Use the parent label as a live link or as a submenu-only grouping control.                 |
| `title`             | Optional hover tooltip.                                                                    |
| `icon`              | Optional Font Awesome 6 icon name.                                                         |
| `presentation`      | Show the icon and label, label only, or icon only.                                         |
| `section`           | Keep the item beside the brand (`left`) or align it to the far edge (`right`).             |
| `surface`           | Show the item in the Brand Navigation `bar` or as a `site_header` icon.                    |
| `device_visibility` | Show on both device classes, desktop/tablet only, or mobile phones only.                   |
| `target`            | Open in the same window (`_self`) or a new window (`_blank`).                              |
| `visibility`        | Show to everyone, anonymous visitors, or authenticated users.                              |
| `children`          | Ordered submenu links below this entry.                                                    |

A top-level entry behaves as:

- a direct link when it has a URL and no children; or
- a submenu control when it has children but no URL; or
- a functioning parent link with a separate submenu caret when it has both a
  URL and children.

Choose `group` when the top-level label should only open its submenu. Group
mode preserves the saved URL for easy re-enabling but does not render it. This
is preferable to placeholder destinations such as `#`.

Every child entry requires a label and URL. Child entries also support a hover
tooltip, optional visible description, icon, target, audience visibility, and
device visibility. A visible description appears as secondary text below its
label. Empty descriptions retain the compact menu. Only one submenu level is
supported; child entries cannot contain another submenu.

For an icon-only link, keep a clear `label`: Brand Navigation uses it as the
link's accessible name. If the configured icon is missing from Discourse's
active icon set, the visible label appears automatically instead of leaving an
empty bar or submenu link.

Top-level items in the `left` section appear beside the brand. Items in the
`right` section form a group at the far edge of the bar, which is useful for
account links and calls to action. On mobile, both sections become one compact
ordered list so every item remains easy to reach.

Set a direct icon link's `surface` to `site_header` to place it among
Discourse's core header icons instead of in the Brand Navigation bar. This is
useful for social destinations when bar space is limited. Site-header items
must have a URL and icon and cannot contain children. Their label remains the
accessible name and their title remains the optional tooltip. A direct
site-header item whose icon is unavailable is omitted instead of rendering an
empty header control. Other items keep the default `bar` surface.

Use `device_visibility` to control constrained mobile layouts independently for
each item:

- `both` shows the item on desktop/tablet devices and mobile phones and is the
  default.
- `desktop` shows the item only on desktop/tablet devices.
- `mobile` shows the item only on mobile phones.

Device visibility follows Discourse's supported physical-device capability, so
rotating a phone does not make Desktop-only items appear. It is independent of
`mobile_mode`, which controls whether the responsive mobile layout uses a menu,
bar, or no Brand Navigation surface.

For a large social set, keep a few priority `site_header` icons on `both`, mark
the remainder `desktop`, and retain a Social submenu on `both` so every
destination remains reachable on mobile. Existing configurations without this
field behave as `both`.

Example navigation plan:

| Top-level entry | URL       | Children               | Result                                                 |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Community       | `/latest` | None                   | Direct internal link                                   |
| Resources       | `/about`  | Documentation, Support | Linked label plus a separate submenu caret             |
| Account help    | `/faq`    | None                   | Direct link that can be limited to authenticated users |

Use relative paths such as `/latest` for destinations on the same Discourse
site. Use complete `https://` URLs for external destinations. Protocol-relative,
HTTP, credential-bearing, script, placeholder, and malformed URLs are rejected
by bundle/editor validation and fail closed at rendering. New-window links
automatically receive the appropriate safety relationship attributes.

## Configure icons

Enter a Font Awesome 6 icon name in an item's `icon` field. Add every icon used
by the component to `custom_font_awesome_icons` so Discourse includes it in the
site icon set. Labels remain required even when an icon is present.

If an icon does not appear, verify its name and confirm it is included in
`custom_font_awesome_icons`.

## Choose placement and mobile behavior

`outlet` controls the desktop bar location:

- `above-site-header` places Brand Navigation above the normal Discourse
  header.
- `below-site-header` places it below the normal Discourse header.

`mobile_mode` controls smaller screens:

- `menu` adds a compact menu button to the Discourse header.
- `bar` displays the full Brand Navigation bar.
- `hidden` does not display any Brand Navigation surface on a responsive mobile
  view, including Brand Navigation links placed in the Discourse site header.

Choose `menu` when space is limited or the navigation contains several items.
Check both portrait and landscape layouts before using `bar`.

## Control who sees a link

Each top-level and child item has an independent visibility setting:

- `everyone` shows the item to all visitors.
- `anonymous` shows the item only to signed-out visitors.
- `authenticated` shows the item only to signed-in users.

Visibility only controls presentation. It is not an authorization mechanism;
protect restricted destinations with Discourse permissions.

## Translate the interface

Brand Navigation uses Discourse's theme-translation system for fixed visitor
and administrator interface text. The `v0.9.x` preview line bundles English in
`locales/en.yml`. This includes navigation accessibility labels, appearance and
configuration-bundle controls, setting descriptions, and status messages.

An administrator can open **Theme translations** for Brand Navigation, select
the locale to customize, and override individual strings without editing the
component repository. These overrides belong to that Discourse site and locale;
repeat the customization for every supported locale that needs different text.
Repository updates normally retain local overrides, but removed or renamed
translation keys should be checked during an upgrade.

Detailed bundle-schema validation messages currently remain English. Standard
panel labels, accessibility text, controls, success messages, and fallback
failure messages use theme translation keys.

Navigation labels, tooltips, and visible descriptions entered in
`navigation_items` are site configuration rather than translation keys. One
configured value is currently shown to every locale. Sites that require
localized navigation content should account for that limitation when enabling
per-user locales.

Reviewed translations can be contributed upstream by adding the appropriate
locale YAML file with the same key structure as `locales/en.yml`. Do not rely on
unreviewed machine translation for public interface text, accessibility labels,
or administrator instructions.

## Use Brand Navigation as a visitor

Select the brand logo or name to open the configured brand destination. Direct
navigation entries open immediately. For a linked parent with children, select
its label to visit the parent destination or its down-caret to open the submenu.
When a parent has no URL, the complete entry opens its submenu.

Keyboard users can press Tab to reach links and submenu controls separately. Press Enter
or Space on a submenu control to expand or collapse it, or Escape to close it
and return focus to its control. Opening another submenu, selecting one of its
links, or selecting outside the submenu also closes it. On mobile sites using
`menu` mode, open the Brand Navigation menu from its menu button in the
Discourse header.

## Verify the configuration

Before enabling the component broadly, check:

1. A normal desktop page with a signed-out visitor.
2. A normal desktop page with a signed-in user.
3. Mobile layout in the selected mobile mode.
4. Every direct link, linked submenu parent, child link, and brand destination.
5. Light and dark color schemes.
6. Keyboard navigation: tab to links and submenu summaries, then use Enter or
   Space to open a submenu and Escape to close it.
7. New-window links.
8. A supported embedded discussion, confirming that Brand Navigation is absent
   while the embedded discussion and its core controls remain available.

Automated checks cover accessible names, responsive visibility, mobile layout,
and embed exclusion. Keyboard and focus-return behavior has source and partial
manual evidence, but not a dedicated current-candidate automated focus-return
regression. These checks do not replace human screen-reader or RTL-locale
acceptance. The exact completed and outstanding manual evidence is maintained
in [`TESTING.md`](/brand-navigation/source/testing-record/).

## Disable or roll back

Turn off Discourse's component-level **Enabled?** control to stop Brand
Navigation from rendering. Disabling the component does not delete its
configuration.

When replacing Brand Header, Header Submenus, or Custom Header Links (icons),
keep the earlier component and an export of its settings until Brand Navigation
has passed staging. See
[Migration and rollback](/brand-navigation/source/migration-record/) for the detailed procedure.

For a regression caused by a Brand Navigation update, keep the existing
component record and review the provisional
[release-tag rollback](/brand-navigation/source/migration-record/#roll-back-brand-navigation-to-a-release-tag).
It is not release-supported until its complete pin-and-return workflow is
recorded on staging in [`TESTING.md`](/brand-navigation/source/testing-record/).

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing appears

- Confirm Discourse's component-level **Enabled?** control is on.
- Confirm the component is attached to the active theme.
- Add at least one navigation item or configure a visible brand name or logo.
- If testing on mobile, confirm `mobile_mode` is not `hidden`.
- Brand Navigation is intentionally absent in supported embed contexts.

### A top-level item is missing

- Confirm it has either a URL or at least one child.
- Check its visibility rule using the appropriate signed-in or signed-out state.
- Check its device visibility in the current desktop or mobile layout.

### A submenu is empty or incomplete

- Confirm each child has both a label and a valid URL.
- Check the visibility rule on each child.
- Check the child device visibility in the current layout.

### The layout is crowded on mobile

Change `mobile_mode` from `bar` to `menu`, mark lower-priority items as
desktop-only, reduce the number of top-level entries, or group related
destinations under submenus.

### The colors do not match the site

Brand Navigation uses Discourse color-scheme variables. Check the active theme
and color scheme before adding parent-theme overrides.
