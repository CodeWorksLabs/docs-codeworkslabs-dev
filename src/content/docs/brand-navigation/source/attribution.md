Brand Navigation was newly authored from its product specifications as an
independent theme component.

See the [authorship and provenance record](/brand-navigation/source/provenance/) for the AI-assisted
authorship model, pinned upstream revisions, implementation-history evidence,
and release controls behind this summary.

## Product inspiration

The following projects informed product discovery, administrator workflows, or
presentation choices. Brand Navigation does not incorporate source code from
these projects merely because they inspired a feature or demonstrated a common
Discourse theme-component pattern.

- [Discourse Brand Header](https://github.com/discourse/discourse-brand-header)
  demonstrated a distinct, site-wide brand surface.
- [Discourse Header Submenus](https://github.com/discourse/discourse-header-submenus)
  demonstrated structured header navigation and exposed administration and
  usability concerns that Brand Navigation addresses independently.
- [Pavilion Dropdown Header](https://github.com/paviliondev/discourse-dropdown-header)
  informed exploration of descriptive dropdown presentation and coexistence
  with other header components.
- [Custom Header Links (icons)](https://github.com/discourse/discourse-icon-header-links)
  demonstrated compact, accessible destinations registered in Discourse's core
  header.

## Historical implementation study

Brand Navigation's core-header icon integration uses Discourse's documented
`api.headerIcons` API. During development, an early implementation adapted the
narrow `curryComponent` registration pattern used by Custom Header Links
(icons). Before the first tagged release, that implementation was replaced by
an independently authored lexical component factory.

Permanent upstream reference:
[initialize-for-header-icon-links.gjs at `dee14e3`](https://github.com/discourse/discourse-icon-header-links/blob/dee14e37185e5e4db38497bd952352405a5826af/javascripts/discourse/initializers/initialize-for-header-icon-links.gjs#L1-L27).

The permanent reference preserves the development history; it does not classify
the current release tree as containing that adapted expression. No copied or
adapted external code is currently identified. Brand Navigation declares
`GPL-2.0-or-later`. If future work copies or adapts code, this record and any
required copyright or license notice must be updated in the same change.
